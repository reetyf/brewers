    "There are fundamental, baseball-driven questions that undoubtedly influence this decision as well. The most important of these is the Brewers' aspirations for the years of player B's most heavy monetary commitment. Just how valuable are the added wins granted by player B in 2023 and 2024? On a team that has World Series aspirations, these added wins could be the difference between winning the central division and a bye or merely a birth in the wild card. So despite player A's team friendly deal over the four years, in certain years it is of the utmost importance to maximize output at each position. In this case, player B would be a better fit. \n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of positional value has a large impact on WAR. It refers to the value of a position player relative to his peers. For example, the shortstop and catcher positions yield higher WAR than 1st basemen for equal performance, due to a wider gap between high and low production players. This has a drastic impact on the decision. For example, in 2022, a first baseman with 2.8 oWAR was Matt Olsen, who triple slashed .240/.325/.477 with 34 HR and 103 RBI. Willson Contrareas, a catcher, had 3.7 oWAR with only 22 HR, 55 RBI and a similar slash of .243/.349/.466.\n",
    "\n",
    "In modern baseball, players are deemed to be more valuable if they are able to play more than one position at a high level. Where as in previous generations, a separate 'utility player' was often rostered, now even stars are proficient at multiple places in the field. This corresponds with the increasingly positionless game that has developed. Even with the incoming ban of extreme shifts, it is an incredible advantage to have these versatile players, and this should be accounted for in free agent negotiations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, it is important to note the increase in free agent contracts and overall salaries around the league. With the increase of average contract length and value in the 2022 free agency class thus far, the total contract value difference between player A and B simply might not be as significant as in previous eras.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summation, player A's contract is a better option strictly speaking in terms of dollar value, but there are factors that might make player B a better option, as well as the sheer influence a player's position has on WAR calculations."

If this system were to be implemented in the majors in 2024, how should teams adjust their team building and gameplay strategies to prepare? Please limit your answer to 300 words."
