    "Before any modelling occurs, it is important to select which features are most relevant for this problem. This helps to determine which model types would be the most useful, as well as helps to reduce noise, or unwanted behaviors by the models. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this instance, there are some extraneous features that would have no effect on the outcome of the play. Namely, `crowd size` and `pitcher/batter historical matchup results` are two of these. The former has on effect on any in-game plays (ignoring the rare 'fan interference'), while the latter would only impact decisions made prior to the beginning of the play, like whether to pinch hit or to rest an everyday starter. In this case, since the play has already began, this data is irrelevant to the problem at hand. Similarly, `identities of all players on field` is superfluous; when the ball is already in the air, the only relevant player is the fielder. The relevant characteristics of the fielder are already accounted for with the `outfielder fielding percentage` and `intial fielder positioning data` features. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the features included in `game state` can be ignored for this problem. These factors are inherently accounted for by `initial fielder positioning`. Because of this, there would be a resulting multicolinearity between fielder positioning and game state factors. For example, if a runner is on third base with less than 2 outs in a bottom of the ninth, the outfielder would be extremely shallow. This linear relationship between these factors is not conducive to forming an applicable model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, `day/night game` can be disregarded in favor of features of other atmospheric conditions. Factors like `wind speed`, ` atmospheric pressure`, and `temperature` (already included) are more specific and tangible than a day or night game.  \n",

The most important of these is the Brewers' aspirations for the years of player B's most heavy monetary commitment. Just how valuable are the added wins granted by player B in 2023 and 2024? On a team that has World Series aspirations, these added wins could be the difference between winning the central division and a bye or merely a birth in the wild card. So despite player A's team friendly deal over the four years, in certain years it is of the utmost importance to maximize output at each position. In this case, player B would be a better fit. \n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of positional value has a large impact on WAR. It refers to the value of a position player relative to his peers. For example, the shortstop and catcher positions yield higher WAR than 1st basemen for equal performance, due to a wider gap between high and low production players. This has a drastic impact on the decision. For example, in 2022, a first baseman with 2.8 oWAR was Matt Olsen, who triple slashed .240/.325/.477 with 34 HR and 103 RBI. Willson Contrareas, a catcher, had 3.7 oWAR with only 22 HR, 55 RBI and a similar slash of .243/.349/.466.\n",

    "In modern baseball, players are deemed to be more valuable if they are able to play more than one position at a high level. Where as in previous generations, a separate 'utility player' was often rostered, now even stars are proficient at multiple places in the field. This corresponds with the increasingly positionless game that has developed. Even with the incoming ban of extreme shifts, it is an incredible advantage to have these versatile players, and this should be accounted for in free agent negotiations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, it is important to note the increase in free agent contracts and overall salaries around the league. With the increase of average contract length and value in the 2022 free agency class thus far, the total contract value difference between player A and B simply might not be as significant as in previous eras.\n",
    "\n",
